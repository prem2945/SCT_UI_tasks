# Fitness App User Journey Prototype

**Project by:** SkillCraft Technology  
**Platform:** Mobile (iOS/Android)  
**Type:** Low-Fidelity Clickable Prototype

## Overview
This is a low-fidelity clickable prototype for a fictional fitness app called "FitLife". The prototype demonstrates the complete user journey from the welcome screen through onboarding, profile setup, and initial fitness goal selection. The prototype is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy access and testing.

## User Journey Flow
1. **Welcome Screen**: Introduces the app and encourages user engagement
2. **Onboarding**: Explains app features and requests necessary permissions
3. **Profile Setup**: Collects user information for personalization
4. **Initial Goals**: Allows users to set their primary fitness objectives
5. **Completion**: Confirms setup and transitions to main app experience

## Design Decisions for Smooth User Experience

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Information is revealed gradually to avoid overwhelming the user
- Each screen focuses on a single task or concept
- Reduces cognitive load and improves completion rates

### 2. Clear Visual Hierarchy
- Consistent header styling with app branding
- Prominent call-to-action buttons
- Progress indicator shows advancement through the flow

### 3. Mobile-First Design
- Prototype sized for mobile devices (375px width)
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing
- Vertical layout optimized for thumb navigation

### 4. Inclusive and Accessible
- High contrast colors for readability
- Large touch targets for accessibility
- Simple language avoiding jargon

### 5. Motivational Tone
- Positive, encouraging messaging throughout
- Focus on benefits and user empowerment
- Builds excitement for the fitness journey

### 6. Data Collection Strategy
- Minimal required information upfront
- Optional fields clearly marked
- Progressive profiling for future enhancements

### 7. Error Prevention
- Input validation and helpful placeholders
- Dropdown menus for structured data
- Clear instructions for each step

### 8. Seamless Transitions
- Smooth screen changes with JavaScript
- Consistent animation and timing
- Maintains user context throughout flow

## Technical Implementation
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- No external dependencies for simplicity

## How to Use
1. Open `user-journey.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Click through the screens to experience the complete user journey
3. The prototype is optimized for mobile view (375px width)
4. Use browser developer tools (F12) to simulate mobile view if viewing on desktop
5. Each screen includes detailed UX annotations at the bottom explaining design decisions

## Screen Flow
1. **Welcome Screen** → Click "Get Started"
2. **Onboarding Screen** → Review features and permissions → Click "Continue"
3. **Profile Setup** → Fill in information (name and age required) → Click "Continue" or "Skip for Now"
4. **Goals Selection** → Select a fitness goal → Click "Set Goal"

## Annotations
Each screen includes a detailed annotation at the bottom (yellow box) explaining:
- UX design decisions
- Rationale behind interface choices
- User experience considerations
- Best practices implemented

These annotations are visible on every screen and provide insight into the design thinking process.

## Future Enhancements
- Add form validation and data persistence
- Implement actual permission requests
- Create high-fidelity designs with branding
- Add animation and micro-interactions
- Integrate with backend services for real data handling
